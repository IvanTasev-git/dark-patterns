                    <h2>Confirmshaming</h2> <br>
                    <iframe src="examples/confirmshaming.html"></iframe> <br><br>
                    <p>Confirmshaming is when websites make the "No" option something terrible to guilt you into saying "Yes" instead. This technique is a favorite among blogs and news sites to get you to subscribe to their newsletters.</p>

                <div>
                    <h2>Fake Notifications</h2> <br>
                    <iframe src="examples/fakenotifications.html"></iframe> <br><br>
                    <p>Social media sites want you to get in the habit of checking your notifications regularly, and so some sites will send you fake notifications. These notifications are not relevant to you but get you into the habit of checking them.</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h2>UI Switcheroo</h2> <br>
                    <iframe src="examples/uiswitcheroo.html"></iframe> <br><br>
                    <p>Just when you're getting hang of the UI layout, some websites will switch it up to trick you. This is usually done to get you to accept something by mistake.</p>

                    <h2>Agree and...</h2> <br>
                    <iframe src="examples/agree.html"></iframe> <br><br>
                    <p>Most sites require you to agree to a TOS after signing up, and so people often check the agree box without reading it. Sites know this, and so some will use the agree button to include signing up for a newsletter and other shady things.</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h2>Contacts Spam</h2> <br>
                    <iframe src="examples/contactspam.html"></iframe> <br><br>
                    <p>Some sites will gain the ability to message your contacts after signing up. They will abuse this access by messaging everyone in your contacts list without your knowledge.</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h2>Download Adverts</h2> <br>
                    <iframe src="examples/downloadadverts.html"></iframe> <br><br>
                    <p>This dark pattern is probably the oldest on this list. These are ads that disguise themselves as the real download button and give you malware instead. Any shady software site will have these.</p>
